# ITIS_4166_Project

*This project is currently in progress!*

For this project, I designed, implemented, and published a Model-View-Controller (MVC) web application for an event app called Dogs Fur Days.

**Project Description:**
This semester, you will design, implement, and publish an MVC web application that incorporates JavaScript, HTML, CSS, EJS, and MongoDB. You will choose an event/meetup domain and categories of interest to you. You must develop your own unique site with branding, categories, and events representative of that domain. Creativity is highly encouraged.

**The following are required for all projects:**

1. Pages must be valid HTML5 standard.
2. You must not use site-builder or automatic site generation tools. You must code your HTML directly, by hand.
3. All pages must validate cleanly as HTML5.
4. All pages must render sensibly cross-browser.
5. All pages must have full and complete separation of CSS into separate files – only the link(s) to load the CSS should be present in the HTML document. No style definitions within the HTML document.
6. All pages must have full and complete separation of JavaScript into separate files – only the link(s) to load should be present in the HTML document. No scripting within the HTML document. This includes inline JavaScript such as onclick.
7. All resources (CSS, JavaScript, Media) must be locally stored with the web application (e.g., local copy of JavaScript libraries). 
8. Each assignment will consider coding efficiency and design choices, which includes coding elegance or style. Efficiency is required to make the best use of resources (many full pages are viewed on mobile devices). Good code design is required for maintenance, understanding, reusability, and extensibility of applications. Proper indentation for nested elements is just one example. Course staff are the final arbiters on efficiency and design choices in this context.
9. Page design choices must be sensible for use by a broad audience. Course staff are the final arbiters on sensibility in this context. Ridiculous and laughable branding / inventory may be fine. Ridiculous and laughable site design / implementation is not.
